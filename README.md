# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection Web Application is a Django-based platform designed to allow users to upload CSV datasets containing credit card transactions, predict fraudulent transactions using a pre-trained machine learning model (XGBoost), and visualize the results through interactive charts. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing datasets, performing predictions, analyzing transaction statistics, and exploring fraud patterns.

# Project Objectives

* Enable users to upload and manage CSV datasets containing credit card transactions.
* Predict fraudulent transactions using a trained XGBoost machine learning model.
* Display fraud predictions and probabilities in a table format.
* Provide statistical summaries of transactions, including average, minimum, maximum amounts, fraud counts, and fraud percentages.
* Visualize fraud distribution and transaction statistics using interactive pie and bar charts.
* Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.


# Tools and Technologies

* **Backend**: Django 
* **Machine Learning**: Python, XGBoost, joblib, pandas, numpy
* **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5.3, Chart.js
* **Python Environment**: Python 3.10, conda environment

# Future Enhancements

* Add user authentication and file access permissions.
* Enable multiple model selection for predictions.
* Include more advanced visualizations like time series fraud trends.
* Provide download options for analyzed and predicted CSV files.
* Improve mobile responsiveness and UI/UX styling.
